# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using R (Shiny App + Machine Learning)

This project is an interactive **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **R** and **Shiny**.  
It predicts a user's heart disease risk using a trained **Random Forest** machine learning model and provides a clean, intuitive interface for entering medical and lifestyle data.

The application includes:

- A modern **3-column input layout**  
- Medical + lifestyle risk factors  
- A trained ML model (Random Forest)  
- A **probability-based prediction**  
- A dedicated **results page**  
- A clean UI with a semi-transparent glass panel and a heart-themed background  

> ⚠️ This project is purely for **educational** and **demonstration** purposes.  
> It is **not a medical tool** and should not be used for real-life diagnosis or treatment.

## 🧠 **Project Objective**

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Build a **machine learning model** to classify heart disease risk based on medical and lifestyle parameters.
2. Create an **interactive UI (Shiny App)** where users can input health metrics and instantly get predictions.
3. Demonstrate how **predictive modeling**, **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, and **deployment** can be integrated into a single end-to-end project.
4. Provide a clean, modern UI experience using HTML/CSS styling inside Shiny.
